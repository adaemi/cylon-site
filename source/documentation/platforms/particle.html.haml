      Both the Particle Core and Particle Photon contain a Wi-Fi connected microcontroller.
      Once it connects to a Wi-Fi network, it automatically connects with a central server (the "Particle Cloud") and stays connected so it can be controlled from external systems, such as a Cylon.js program.
